    <p>Hi, I'm Julia. I'm a frontend developer and accessibility advocate. I'm currently a student at
      the University of Vienna of Digital Humanities. I am interested in spreading awareness of accessibility at all
      levels.</p>
    <p>This website contains data charts and background information, created for the lecture Telling Data Stories.</p>

      <p>Hey everyone, my name is Julia, and I'm a self-taught front-end developer and Accessibility Advocate.
        Those who know me may have noticed that I started studying Digital Humanities, which seems to be a completely
        different
        field. Even though, I still focus on accessibility to spread the word.
        Because I always find a way to involve accessibility.</p>
      <p>In this semester's class called "Telling Data stories," I learned about data visualization.
        Before I took this class, I had absolutely no idea what it was going to be about, what I was going to learn, BUT
        I was
        interested in taking it because I knew that there are still so many difficulties when it comes to making data
        visualization accessible.
        So I knew data visualization from a different perspective.
        And I thought that in order to understand how to make data accessible to everyone, I should understand data
        itself and
        how to visualize it and take this course. And it was a good choice.</p>
      <p>In the beginning, I learned some basics, such as what data visualization is, how to work with data, how long
        data
        visualization has even existed, and what tools to use to create meaningful charts.
        Over the course of the semester, each student had to work in a group of about 5 people to create a presentation
        on
        different types of graphs.
        I assigned myself to the last group that focused on UI design and best practices.
        Of course! Because here I was able to talk a lot about accessibility and make the other students aware of some
        difficulties and show them how to make their charts accessible to everyone as they go deeper into their studies.
      </p>
      <p>So not only did I learn about data visualization in general, but I also created different types of graphs
        showing
        different types of data using different programming languages and tools like R, Python, or Jasp.
        And as a personal addition, I was able to design this lecture on accessibility in different ways.
        I could introduce the topic to other students by giving a presentation, learn how to make charts accessible and
        what
        best practices are out there.</p>
      <p>And in the end, I was even able to take it a step further when I had to create a portfolio of what I learned in
        class.
        This portfolio will be my very first project of an accessible docx, exported as both HTML and PDF, to apply best
        practices for an Accessible Document, which will help me get the Accessible Document Specialist certificate I'm
        aiming
        for this summer.
        So, if you are thinking about taking a class on data visualization, you should definitely do so.
        You can learn a lot more about it than you might think in the beginning. For me personally it was a complete
        success.</p>

      <p><b>What is data visualisation?</b></p>Data visualization is the process of using visual elements such as
      charts, graphs, or maps to represent data. It translates complex, or numerical data into a visual representation
      that is easier to process.
      <p><b>Putting data on maps</b></p> Use maps to show, e.g., the frequency of an earthquake in a certain area, the
      election results in a certain country or simply where you have traveled. R can be a good choice for visualization.
      <p><b>Basic descriptive graphs</b></p> Start slowly with simple graphs like pie charts, bar charts and such. Learn
      how to work with data and tools like R and Python (better) to visualize it.Try to make the graphs accessible to
      everyone.
      <p><b>Special descriptive graphs</b></p> Now that you're more comfortable with using data and tools it's time to
      create more complex graphs like heatmaps or dendrograms. Make a conscious decision about which graphs visualize
      your data best and which tools to use.
      <p><b>Telling more with info viz</b></p> But there is so much more. Present your created graphs with the help of
      e.g. an infographic, which is often used for visual storytelling, and give the reader more background information
      about your project.
      <p><b>Best practices</b></p> Take one last look at your graphs. Have you applied best practices? Can everyone
      understand your graph and is it accessible to all? If yes, then you are good to go.
      You did it! Keep up the good work.
