    <p>Hi, I'm Julia. I'm a frontend developer and accessibility advocate. I'm currently a student at
      the University of Vienna of Digital Humanities. I am interested in spreading awareness of accessibility at all
      levels.</p>
    <p>This website contains data charts and background information, created for the lecture Telling Data Stories.</p>

      <p><b>What is data visualisation?</b></p>Data visualization is the process of using visual elements such as
      charts, graphs, or maps to represent data. It translates complex, or numerical data into a visual representation
      that is easier to process.
      <p><b>Putting data on maps</b></p> Use maps to show, e.g., the frequency of an earthquake in a certain area, the
      election results in a certain country or simply where you have traveled. R can be a good choice for visualization.
      <p><b>Basic descriptive graphs</b></p> Start slowly with simple graphs like pie charts, bar charts and such. Learn
      how to work with data and tools like R and Python (better) to visualize it.Try to make the graphs accessible to
      everyone.
      <p><b>Special descriptive graphs</b></p> Now that you're more comfortable with using data and tools it's time to
      create more complex graphs like heatmaps or dendrograms. Make a conscious decision about which graphs visualize
      your data best and which tools to use.
      <p><b>Telling more with info viz</b></p> But there is so much more. Present your created graphs with the help of
      e.g. an infographic, which is often used for visual storytelling, and give the reader more background information
      about your project.
      <p><b>Best practices</b></p> Take one last look at your graphs. Have you applied best practices? Can everyone
      understand your graph and is it accessible to all? If yes, then you are good to go.
      You did it! Keep up the good work.
